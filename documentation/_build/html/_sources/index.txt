FigDiv: Rule-based musical figure divination
=======================================================

FigDiv is a tool for automated, rule-based divination of figured bass from unfigured musical scores. It can be used both for performance and study; musicians can use it to avoid the tedius task of figuring un-figured scores, and musicologists can use it to study the interaction and application of rules used to do the figuring.

FigDiv was created as part of the `Centre de Recherche sur l'Interpr√©tation au Clavecin (CRIC) <http://cric.music.mcgill.ca/>`_, which is associated with McGill's `Schulich School of Music <http://www.mcgill.ca/music/>`_. CRIC is funded in part by the `Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) <http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/Default.aspx>`_.
