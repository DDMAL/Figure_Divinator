Usage:

	python python usage: extractor.py [-r RULES_TYPE] [-o] input_file


Usage (for the fully uninitiated!):
To run a file through the dummy rules, use:
	python extractor.py yourfile.xml

To have the output file open in your musicXML reader, add the -o flag:
	python extractor.py yourfile.xml -o

To use a particular set of extraction rules, add the -r <rules> flag:
	python extractor.py yourfile.xml -r SL

The -o and -r flags can be used together.

The input file will remain unchanged; the output file will be saved in
the same directory as yourfile_figured_bass_type.xml.
