Rules for figuring unfigured bass parts
Written out by Konstantin, Fall 2011;
Re-tooled by Hank & Hannah Spring 2012

*** Questions:
    Intervals -- diatonic v chromatic? when? never v always? ahh! (currently chromatic)

    Are the figures listed by music21 a comlete list of all whe'd ever need? see http://mit.edu/music21/doc/html/moduleFiguredBassNotation.html?highlight=figured#music21.figuredBass.notation

    Major third: Does 3# always mean major third? Does 3 ever not mean major third? Are we allowed to know key signature? Thirds and key in general.

*** NOTES ***
    Using SL text from 1707

Rule 3 
    K's rule:   1
    Page:       45
    Conditions: 
        * When the bass note goes up by a semitone
    Figures:
        * First note gets a 6
        * Second gets nothing.
    Notes:      
        * A generalization of SL1
        * Confirms that we don't want augmented unison
    Questions?
        * Confirm what happens with second note!!!

    Notes:      
        * Hh{perfect=='minor triad'}
