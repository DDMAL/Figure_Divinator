Rules for figuring unfigured bass parts
Written out by Konstantin, Fall 2011;
Re-tooled by Hank & Hannah Spring 2012

*** Questions:
    Are the figures listed by music21 a comlete list of all whe'd ever need? see http://mit.edu/music21/doc/html/moduleFiguredBassNotation.html?highlight=figured#music21.figuredBass.notation

    Major third: Does 3# always mean major third? Does 3 ever not mean major third? Are we allowed to know key signature? Thirds and key in general.

    *Figure out how to implement:
        * Long notes  that require multiple figures, first note sol second note ut:
            * in duple time (numerator even), first figure goes on first half, second on second
            * In triple time (numerator is divisible by 3), first figure either 2/3 and second note on 1/3 or vice versa.

*** NOTES ***
    * Using SL text from 1707
    * These rules are from Chapter 7 - 'Rules for divining the figures when the bass isn't figured'
    * Cadence assumption: last note falls on first note

    SKIPPED:
        * Rule 1: Covered by rule 3.
        * Rule 2: More about the realization of the bass than about extraction.
        * Rule 4: 5/# --> 6/3 /ascending diatonic semitone
        * Rule 9
            K's rule:   NA
            Page:       47
            Conditions:
                * bass note rises by a minor third
            Figures:

    Page:       55
    Conditions:
        * When bass note goes up a tone
        * [second interval] then up a tone
        * [third interval] then up a semitone
        * [fourth interval] then up a tone
    Figures:
        * 1st note gets no figure (5,3) "l'accord parfait"
        * 2nd note gets a 6+ "l'accord simple" or (6+,4,3) "l'petit accord"
        * 3rd note gets a 6 "l'accord double" or (6,3) "l'accord simple" #Hnote: don't put in l'accord simple this time
        * 4th note gets a 5,3 (l'accord parfait) or (6,5,3)
        * 5th note gets l'accord parfait majeur (perfect major triad) 5,3+
    Note:
        * major version: ut re me fa sol
        * SL prefers the variants to the simple version
        * Note: pay attention to variants when doing the realization! :)

    Figures:
        * 1st note gets 5,3+(7)
